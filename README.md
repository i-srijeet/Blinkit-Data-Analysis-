It gives an overview of customer behaviour, product categories, delivery performance, inventory basically showing the operations and supply chain management of BLINKIT.

📌 Project Overview Domain: E-Commerce / Retail Analytics

Tool Used: Microsoft Power BI

Duration: April 1, 2025 – June 30, 2025 (3 months)

Internship Organization: Classroom Tech

🎯 Objective:

Measure **on‑time delivery performance** and quantify **delivery delays**.  
- Analyse **distance vs. delivery time** to assess delivery efficiency.  
- Build **map / heatmap visuals** for order density by pincode.  
- Create **RLS (Row Level Security)** by customer/store segment.  
- Implement **alerts** for low stock or SLA breaches (Power BI Service).  
- Provide **drill-through** pages to inspect order/feedback details.  
- Calculate **customer retention** based on `total_orders`.

- 🗂️ Data Sources

**Primary CSV:** `blinkit_delivery_performance.csv`  
Columns previewed during analysis:

- `order_id`
- `delivery_partner_id`
- `promised_time`
- `actual_time`
- `delivery_time_minutes`
- `distance_km`
- `delivery_status`
- `reasons_if_delayed`

 Key Points Analyzed :

1. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

2. Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)

3. Gross Profit

4. Delivery Delays

5. Campaign Conversion Funnel

6. Product-wise Stock, Damage Rates, and Revenue

7. Dashboard Highlights

8. Monthly & daily order volume trends

9. Delivery performance by status and distance

10. Product-wise sales, stock, and damage tracking

Logistics Bottleneck: Delivery delays peaked in November 2023, including short-distance zones

Top Categories: Pet Care led in volume; Dairy & Breakfast drove the highest revenue

Marketing Gaps: Just 1% of 29.49M ad impressions converted, indicating a steep funnel drop-off

Inventory Concerns: Dish Soap had a 64% damage rate, the highest among all items

💡 Recommendations

>> Streamline delivery logistics, especially for short-distance orders
>> Launch loyalty programs for high-CLV customers to boost retention
>> Implement packaging audits and supplier evaluations to reduce inventory damage
